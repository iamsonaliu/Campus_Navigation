            <p>
                Welcome to CAMPUSNAV-AI, a project developed by a team of passionate students from the Hill Campus. Our goal is to make navigation seamless for students, faculty, and visitors, both inside and outside the campus. We’ve integrated AI-powered pathfinding, live location mapping, and a chatbot to assist Hill Campus students with their daily needs.
